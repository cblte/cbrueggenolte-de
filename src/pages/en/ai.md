## How I Use Generative AI on This Blog and in My Life

_This is an my AI page inspired by [Damola Morenikeji](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto/)._
The main essence of this `/ai/` page is to promote trust and transparency.

### Writing

I incorporate AI into some aspects of this website:

- No content is entirely is written or generated by AI.
- Some images might be created using AI.
- AI assists with formatting, proofreading, enhancing clarity, and expanding text.

I rely on local AI tools on my MacBook,
including [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/),
[Enchanted](https://github.com/gluonfield/enchanted),
and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
for most of the above mentioned tasks.

#### A Quick Note

While I don't let AI write my first drafts,
I do rely on it to help me clean up my work.
Writing isn't about having AI think for me;
it's about using AI as a tool to perfect my ideas and thoughts.
As AI or a LLM is still just a machineâ€”
it doesn't think,
it doesn't know what's true or false.
But what it excels at is organizing vast amounts of information in a way that's easily accessible.
And that is pretty impressive.

### In My Life

LLMs (Large Language Models) come in handy for:

- Finding answers to tricky questions.
- Breaking down complex concepts.
- Summarizing articles.
- Extracting information from long texts.
- Autocompleting code.
- Formatting text and code in ways that would otherwise be time-consuming.

Of course,
I could also just ask an LLM to tell me a fun story.

Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022,
I've used it to help me write more polished text.
My interest in AI,
particularly LLMs,
has grown significantly,
and I continue to find them invaluable for many tasks.

I also use the voice mode of ChatGPT.
When I'm on the road,
I listening to many podcasts.
If I come across something unclear,
I simply ask ChatGPT for clarification.

In the realm of programming,
I tried Copilot for a while but eventually switched to using local LLMs via Ollama after discovering [Zed](https://zed.dev) and the [Continue](https://continue.dev/) VSCode extension.

In mid-2024,
I came across [fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric),
a framework by Daniel Miessler.
It's packed with over two hundred curated patterns that help with summarizing or pulling key points from various documents,
talks,
or transcripts.
I've found this tool incredibly helpful for streamlining complex tasks.
