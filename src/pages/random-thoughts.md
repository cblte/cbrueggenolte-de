This is my random thoughts or previously named "random notes" page. I do use Apple Notes often, actually multiple times daily. But instead of creating multiple notes, I find myself in just adding more information at the top of a single note per week. Old notes move down and new stuff gets added at the top. With the relaunch of this site, I will probably use this here more often. The difference to my notes is, that the newest entry here is found at the [bottom](#bottom).

Notes from the previously blog project, my Flask Blog I started in 2022, will be added over time, or not. Totally depends if the topic is still relevant and if I can dedicate some time in transporting them over.

If you see something like "RT 20230405" then you can add "#20230405" that to the url as a anchor to jump to that entry.

This is the random thoughts document. I restarted it in 20250401 with the redesign of my website. This is an experiment to save random thoughts when I have something that I want to keep but don't know where to put it.

The new Nintendo Switch 2 has been unveiled. At 470 euros, it is definitely more expensive than I expected. It's going to be a pretty expensive Christmas for many this year. At [JPGames.de](https://jpgames.de/2025/04/die-nintendo-switch-2-vorbestellen-die-ersten-haendler-in-deutschland-legen-los/) there is a list of pre-order links for popular electronics stores.

The End As Of Now.
