So, with the relaunch of my website,
I decided to create a space for shorter posts.
This is where I'll share random thoughts
and ideas that don't quite fit into a full blog post.

## Welcome to My Microblog

So, welcome to my "Microblog"
(you could also call it "Random Thoughts" or "Random Notes").
It's a place for quick ideas,
links,
comments,
or anything too short—or not yet ready—for a full post.

If you see something like "RT 20230405"
you can use the following format to jump directly to the entry: "[#20250401](#20250401)".

### A Note

Entries from my previous blog project,
my Flask blog, which I started in 2022,
will be added over time.
Whether or not they make it depends on how relevant the topic is to me these days
and if I can find the time to move them over.

This might move at some point to a subdomain.

Finishing my text on [A.I.](/ai/).
Inspired by "[The /ai 'manifesto'](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto)".

I still find it amazing
how people can survive while staring at their smartphones and texting,
wearing headphones and walking down the street.

The new Nintendo Switch 2 has been unveiled.
At 470 euros, it's definitely more expensive than I expected.
Looks like a lot of us are in for a pricey Christmas this year.
If you're looking to pre-order,
[JPGames.de](https://jpgames.de/2025/04/die-nintendo-switch-2-vorbestellen-die-ersten-haendler-in-deutschland-legen-los/)
has a list of popular german electronics retail stores accepting pre-orders.

This is the random thoughts document.
I restarted it in 20250401 with the redesign of my website.
This is an experiment to save random thoughts
when I have something that I want to keep
but don't know where to put it.

Russian propaganda is flooding the internet with fake news,
not just targeting humans
but also manipulating data that language models like ChatGPT rely on,
leading to widespread dissemination of misinformation.
