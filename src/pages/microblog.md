So, with the relaunch of my website,
I decided to create a space for shorter posts.
This is where I'll share random thoughts
and ideas that don't quite fit into a full blog post.

## Welcome to My Microblog

So, welcome to my "Microblog"
(you could also call it "Random Thoughts" or "Random Notes").
It's a place for quick ideas,
links,
comments,
or anything too short—or not yet ready—for a full post.

### A Note

Entries from my previous blog project,
my Flask blog, which I started in 2022,
will be added over time.
Whether or not they make it depends on how relevant the topic is to me these days
and if I can find the time to move them over.

If you see something like "RT 20230405"
you can use the following format to jump directly to the entry: "[#20250401](#20250401)".

## 20250404

I still find it amazing
how people can survive while staring at their smartphones and texting,
wearing headphones and walking down the street.

Finishing my text on [A.I.](/ai/).

## 20250401

This is the random thoughts document.
I restarted it in 20250401 with the redesign of my website.
This is an experiment to save random thoughts
when I have something that I want to keep
but don't know where to put it.
