## How I Use Generative AI on This Blog and in My Life

_This is an my AI page inspired by [Damola Morenikeji](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto/)._
The main essence of this `/ai/` page is to promote trust and transparency.

### Writing

I use AI for everything related to this website:

- No content is entirely generated or written by AI.
- Some images may be generated.
- AI may be used for formatting, proofreading, enhancing clarity, and augmenting written texts.
- I use local AI tools on my MacBook with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), [Enchanted](https://github.com/gluonfield/enchanted), and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

#### Note

I don't use artificial intelligence to write the first drafts of posts on this site.
I believe that LLMs (Large Language Models) and AI shouldn't do the thinking process for me
because it feels like the AI is telling me what to think.
However, with the power of AI, there are no more excuses for texts full of typos or grammatical errors.
But in its basic form, AI is still a machine that cannot think;
it doesn't know what is true or false.
But it does have access to vast amounts of information which it can retrieve
and put into an easy-to-use format for you.
That is really impressive.

### In My Life

I use LLMs (Large Language Models) for:

- Finding answers to difficult questions.
- Getting explanations of complicated things.
- Summarizing articles.
- Extracting information from text.
- Auto-completing code.
- Reformating text and code in ways that would be annoying to do manually.

On the other hand,
you could also just ask an LLM to tell you a nice story.

Since ChatGPT was released in 2022,
I have been using it to help me write texts without many typos or grammar mistakes.
My interest in A.I.,
especially LLMs,
has grown significantly since then,
and I find them extremely useful in many situations.

I also occasionally use the talking mode of the ChatGPT app.
While driving to work, I listen to many podcasts,
and whenever I hear something that is not clear enough,
I ask ChatGPT to explain it to me.

When it comes to programming,
I used Copilot for a while
but switched to using local LLMs through Ollama
when I learned about the editor [Zed](https://zed.dev) and the VSCode extension [Continue](https://continue.dev/).

I came across the [fabric framework](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)
by Daniel Miessler (https://danielmiessler.com) in mid-2024.
It's got over two hundred handcrafted patterns for all kinds of use cases.
I've found this to be super helpful, especially when I need to summarize or get the main points from a talk, document, or transcript.
