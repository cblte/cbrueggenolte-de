Today we went to the Asien Supermarkt.
We're making Ramen and,
as you need authentic Japanese ingredients to make proper Japanese Ramen,
it is basically the only place where you can get them.

Since the weather was so nice and sunny,
we decided to bike there instead of driving.
It turned out to be a great trip -
getting all that fresh air and sunshine was exactly what we needed.

Right now, the broth is simmering on the stove
with meat, leek, garlic, and kombu (seaweed).
Later, we'll strain the broth
and then add soy sauce, sake, and mirin to give it that rich, authentic flavor.
This is our first attempt at making ramen from scratch,
but I'm pretty sure it's going to taste awesome!
