This build deals insane damage for all weapons and is my most versatile Rafa build so far!
Use any weapon, become incredibly tanky and shoot really fast!
I hope you enjoy the build as much as I did playing this.

Still a work in progress, update with more details and screenshots later

## Overview

- **Build Type:** Weapon Damage / Overdrive Build
- **Playstyle:** High mobility, constant shooting, strong mobbing & bossing
- **Key Mechanic:** Overdrive skills boost all offensive stats while the Action Skill is active.
- **Action Skill:** *Peacebreaker Cannons*
- **Core Idea:** Stack and multiply Overdrive bonuses for massive weapon damage, fire rate, crit chance, and ammo regeneration – Action Skill runs practically non-stop.

## Vault Hunter Trait: **Overdrive**

- Base Effect: +10% damage during Action Skill.
- Massively boosted via stacks and class mod (Dancer): weapon damage, fire rate, ammo regeneration, and crit chance.
- Stacks generated by skills and reset when Overdrive ends.
- Dancer mod doubles these bonuses while active.

## Action Skill: **Peacebreaker Cannons**

Hybrid skill that primarily triggers Overdrive and synergizes with weapon damage.

### Augments

1. **Bullet Buddy Deluxe** *(Bossing)*

- Regenerates ammo into the magazine.
- On reactivation: 8s unlimited ammo.

- Top bossing augment.

2. **Instinto** *(Mobbing)*

- Increases crit chance/damage of cannons.
- Extends Action Skill on kill.
- Makes Overdrive nearly permanent during mobbing.
