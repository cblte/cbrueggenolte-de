DuckDuckDuck Browser got an Update.
They also announced a better onboarding experience
when signing up for their [DuckDuckDuck Privacy Pro](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy-pro/) service.
Beside a VPN it includes _Personal Information Removal_
and _Identity Theft Restoration_.
But with with 10 Euros/Month I think it is still
on the more expensive side.
It might be worth it for you,
if you are concerned about your privacy and security.
