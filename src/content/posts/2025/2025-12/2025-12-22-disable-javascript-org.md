I recently came across **disable-javascript.org** via Marius’ website:
[https://マリウス.com/disable-javascript-org/](https://マリウス.com/disable-javascript-org/)

The idea resonated immediately.
The initiative highlights structural problems in today’s JavaScript-heavy web
and explains — clearly and pragmatically — how to disable JavaScript by default
and only enable it for websites you actually trust.

What followed after the introduction of the tab behavior is telling.
While some reactions were playful,
a noticeable amount of criticism emerged
as well — largely from web developers — framing the approach as unnecessary,
hostile, or even extremist.
One recurring theme in these responses can be summarized
as questioning the practicality or consistency of disabling JavaScript at all.

This criticism misses the point,
and I fully agree with Marius here.
The core message is not “never use JavaScript,”
but **“don’t blindly execute arbitrary code from unknown sources.”**
Well-known platforms may be relatively trustworthy;
random, unfamiliar sites are not.
Treating both the same is a security anti-pattern, not convenience.

I also share his frustration
that many of these objections stem from people simply not reading
what is actually being said.
The recommendation is stated plainly:
disable JavaScript by default,
then selectively enable it where you have an established trust relationship.
Yet many responses argue against a position that was never taken.
This is less a technical disagreement
and more a symptom of how shallow online discourse has become.

For the avoidance of doubt: I do use JavaScript myself.
On pages that contain code, for example,
I enable it deliberately to provide small quality-of-life improvements
such as one-click copy functionality.
This is precisely the model being advocated—JavaScript
as an optional enhancement, not as a prerequisite for accessing content.

The accusation of “militant techno-minimalism” is therefore particularly misplaced.
This stance is neither nostalgic nor anti-progress.
It is about restoring sane defaults.
Pages should remain functional without JavaScript wherever possible,
with scripting used as a deliberate enhancement —
not as a mandatory execution layer
that turns basic content delivery into a fragile runtime environment.

Framing this position as radical
says more about the current state of the web than about the argument itself.
Questioning the wisdom of executing untrusted code by default should not be controversial.
It should be obvious.

That is precisely why **disable-javascript.org** matters.
It turns an uncomfortable nudge into a concrete initiative:
explaining real risks,
offering practical guidance,
and encouraging a healthier balance between security,
usability, and user agency.
