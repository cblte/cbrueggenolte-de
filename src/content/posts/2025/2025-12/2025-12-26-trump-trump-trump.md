The world seems to be fixated on Donald Trump these days.
News outlets, social media platforms,
and casual conversations alike
are dominated by discussions about him.
It's as if every headline, tweet,
and chatter revolves around Trump,
regardless of the actual topic at hand.
This obsession raises questions about our collective focus
and the implications of such a singular narrative
on public discourse and societal priorities.
