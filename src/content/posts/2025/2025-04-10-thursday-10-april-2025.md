This thing with the tariffs is just crazy.
First he shocked the world by introducing a lot of them
with sort of random made-up numbers.
And then all of a sudden Trump suspends tariffs for Europe initially for a period of 90 days.
This pause does not apply to China, where tariffs rise to 125 percent.
Poor Chinese people.

The interesting fact here is that before announcing the tariffs,
he freed up the sale of his TMTG shares. ([futurism.com](https://futurism.com/truth-social-stock-tariffs.))
He also declared on TruthSocial less than four hours before announcing the pause on tariffs,
that now would be an great time to buy. ([apnews](https://apnews.com/article/trump-truth-social-djt-tesla-musk-tariffs-pause-fccfa6b06c8f1ec0cd7844641ca52669))
Does this not represent insider trading?

Today I also found the funny YouTube channel of [demonflyingfox](https://www.youtube.com/@demonflyingfox)
who produces hilarious AI generated videos with well know figures
like Harry Potter, Super Mario and Futurama.
[Democratic Penguins Republic](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=HJ8qGOe2K0o) can be seen as reason #6174295380 why generative AI is the future and here to stay.

I also discovered a way to hide draft blog posts from my website
until I'm ready to publish them.
I did this by checking the environment variable `import.meta.env.PROD`.
When this variable is set, the site automatically filters out all drafts. Simple and effective.
I also fixed the tag loop that wasn't working correctly
when the `tags` metadata existed in the frontmatter but had no tags listed.
