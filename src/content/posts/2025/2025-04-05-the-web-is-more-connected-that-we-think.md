Today, I subscribed to the [People & Blocks newsletter](https://peopleandblocks.com/),
a weekly series that highlights interesting people and their blogs.
And pretty much right away, I ran into [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org).
Again.
Because I first heard about Matt sometime last year
thanks to his [AI clock project: Poem/1](https://www.actsnotfacts.com/made/ai-clock).
A clock that generates poetry along the current time, powered by ChatGPT — not your average wall decoration.

But the way I ended up back at his website is the more interesting story
and why I think, the web is more connected that we think
and that we do not need big tech with their platforms to stay connected.

It started yesterday evening:
I was sittig in front of my page about how I use AI (spoiler: not for writing full blog posts).
I was doing that
because I came across the [AI Manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto) by [Damola Morenikeji](https://damola.com).
From there, I browsed around the [slashAI.page](https://slashai.page/) listing other peoples pages about their us of AI,
clicked a few links (as you do),
and suddenly found myself on [kagi.com](https://kagi.com) [^kagi].

I had heard about Kagi before, but never really took the time to fully explore it.
Kagi is a search engine that promises to be the opposite of Google.
No ads, no tracking, no algorithmic manipulation.
Instead, it’s all about user privacy and a clean search experience.
Anyway.

Coming back to Kagi this morning, I found out about the [Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) [^project] — a lovingly curated collection of personal websites.
I hit "Next Post" a couple of times and landed on [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/), which I already follow for his AI related content.

And from there? Straight into the People & Blocks interview with Matt Webb.
Full circle, basically.

People always say the internet is huge. And it is — if you're looking at cat videos or arguing about pineapple on pizza. Still not as huge as the [deep web]() [^deepweb], but that’s a different story.
But when you stick to your bubble of interests, it suddenly feels cozy, small, and familiar.
It’s almost like a digital small town where everyone somehow knows everyone.

Fittingly, Matt’s site is literally called `interconnected.org`.
Sometimes the universe has a sense of humor too.

Here’s a quote from the interview that stuck with me [^simonquoted]:

> Blogging has become a political act once again. It’s about making a statement by putting your words in a place where they aren’t subject to someone else’s algorithm dictating what success looks like; when you blog, your words are not a vote for the values of another platform.

This hit home.
Over the years, my backends have changed, my layouts have changed, my writing rhythm has changed.
But the reason I keep blogging?
It’s simple: it’s my space. My words, my terms.
And my website where I can do whater the hell I want with it.

Again, the web is gigantic, sure.
But when you move through it following your passions, it feels wonderfully small — and a lot more human.

[^kagi]: Kagi is a search engine that focuses on privacy and user experience.
[^project]: The smallweb project on ([github.com](https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb)).
[^deepweb]: The deep web refers to parts of the internet that are not indexed by traditional search engines. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web) / [nordvpn](https://nordvpn.com/blog/what-is-the-dark-web/#surface-web-vs-deep-web-vs-dark-web-what%E2%80%99s-the-difference)
[^simonquoted]: Which is funny because it is the same piece that [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/matt-webb/) quoted on his blog.
